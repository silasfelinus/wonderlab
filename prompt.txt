Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I have a vue.js project. I need your help completing my code. I hav the following structure and I'm trying to follow best practices.
I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools.
I care a lot about having a pleasing design, and I haven't yet built myself a gui that I find pleasing to look at, so any assistance with programmatic design tips would be a BIG help.
A previous ChatGPT instructed me about SCSS, and we setup a basic structure. That was a great choice, and I appreciate any other advice like it to programmatically scaffold designs.
I was advised to implement Quasar, but other than installing it, I have done nothing with it, and will need guidance as we look at the App.vue.

This is what I have so far:

Project_id: "Widget Wonderlab"
Intent: "A single-screen Vue web app designed to provide a modern, sleek, fast, and friendly sandbox to save, load, share, and create WonderWidgets."
Dev Environment: Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome
Installed Modules: Vue 3, TypeScript, SCSS, Vuex, Vue-Draggable, Quasar
Principles: Material Design, Composition API

[Front-End Experience]:

patrially-collapsile Sidebar on right
ChatWindow on left
below ChatWindow, left Footer is stopped by Sidebar
centered of screen, square WonderLab
centered inside Wonderlab, Button


[Structure: Material Design]
Component:Desired Effects

./src/components/Header.vue: Fixed at the top, provides the ability to save/load lab states, create new widgets, manage user login, and toggle night mode.
./src/components/Sidebar.vue: Partially-collapsible, contains a variety of drag-and-droppable Material Design icons to activate options within widgets and the lab. 
./src/components/Footer.vue: Displays copyright information.
./src/components/ChatWindow.vue: Partially-collapsible component on the left side for user interaction.
./src/components/WonderLab.vue: A grid-based workspace for building, saving, and sharing WonderWidgets, utilizing a step-based save system for easy progress tracking
./src/components/WonderWidget.vue: GUI-abstracted programmed-API calls to language processing APIs, featuring at least one input_grommet, output_grommet, and data display.

[Sidebar Icons, to be created, will need stylish programmatic representation to fill in]: new_text_input, new_text_display, new_image_input, new_image_output, new_robot, new_drop_down_bar,new_microphone, new_speaker, new_cables, new_widget, new_garbage_shed, new_button



Key Features:

Draggable and resizable components
Various optional settings, such as text fields, drop-down selections, and data display.
User-friendly drag-and-drop sorting.
Step-Based Save System:
Supported File Types: txt, yaml, json, jpg, png.

I'm sending main.ts to establish a beginning chain of programming:
#./main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import store from './store';
import './styles/main.scss';
import { Quasar } from 'quasar';
import 'quasar/dist/quasar.css';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(store);
app.use(Quasar);
app.mount('#app');
