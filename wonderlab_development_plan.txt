Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I have a vue.js project. I need your help completing my code. I hav the following structure and I'm trying to follow best practices.
I'm a code-school dropout'looking to monetize my skills, and I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools, all packaged as a legitimately impressive solo project.

This is what I have so far:

roject_id: "Widget Wonderlab"
Intent: "A single-screen Vue web app designed to provide a modern, sleek, fast, and friendly sandbox to save, load, share, and create WonderWidgets."
Dev Environment: Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome
Installed Modules: Vue 3, TypeScript, SCSS, Vuex, Vue-Draggable, Quasar
Principles: Material Design, Composition API

[Front-End Experience]:

patrially-collapsile Sidebar on right
ChatWindow on left
below ChatWindow, left Footer is stopped by Sidebar
centered of screen, square WonderLab
centered inside Wonderlab, Button


[Structure: Material Design]
Component:Desired Effects

./src/components/Header.vue: Fixed at the top, provides the ability to save/load lab states, create new widgets, manage user login, and toggle night mode.
./src/components/Sidebar.vue: Partially-collapsible, contains a variety of drag-and-droppable Material Design icons to activate options within widgets and the lab. 
./src/components/Footer.vue: Displays copyright information.
./src/components/ChatWindow.vue: Partially-collapsible component on the left side for user interaction.
./src/components/WonderLab.vue: A grid-based workspace for building, saving, and sharing WonderWidgets, utilizing a step-based save system for easy progress tracking.
./src/components/WonderWidget.vue: GUI-abstracted programmed-API calls to language processing APIs, featuring at least one input_grommet, output_grommet, and data display.

[Sidebar Icons, to be created, will need stylish programmatic representation to fill in]: new_text_input, new_text_display, new_image_input, new_image_output, new_robot, new_drop_down_bar,new_microphone, new_speaker, new_cables, new_widget, new_garbage_shed, new_button



Key Features:

Draggable and resizable components
Various optional settings, such as text fields, drop-down selections, and data display.
User-friendly drag-and-drop sorting.
Step-Based Save System:
Supported File Types: txt, yaml, json, jpg, png.

[Empty Components]
./src/components/: Button.vue, ChatWindow.vue, Footer.vue, Header.vue, Sidebar.vue, TextInput.vue, Wonderlab.vue, WonderWidget.vue



./src/App.vue (needs to be looked at)
I'm sending main.ts to establish a beginning chain of programming:
#./main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import store from './store';
import './styles/main.scss';
import { Quasar } from 'quasar';
import 'quasar/dist/quasar.css';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(store);
app.use(Quasar);
app.mount('#app');


Project Setup:
a. Initialize a new project using Vue CLI, and select Vue 3, Typescript, and Vuex as the main technologies.
b. Set up a GitHub repository and configure continuous integration using GitHub Actions.
c. Integrate Quasar as the UI framework.

Application Structure:
a. Set up the main application structure and components (App.vue, HeaderComponent.vue, SidebarComponent.vue, WonderLab.vue, WonderWidget.vue, CustomProperties.vue, and FooterComponent.vue).
b. Implement global state management using Vuex.
c. Configure routing for different user roles and authenticated/unauthenticated users.

Authentication:
a. Implement email/password-based authentication using a secure library or service.
b. Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for a seamless authentication experience.
c. Implement role-based access control for guest, user, and admin roles.

Responsive Design:
a. Utilize Quasar's built-in responsive design components and utilities.
b. Test the application across various devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop) and adjust layout and styles accordingly.

User Roles and Sharing:
a. Develop functionality to manage user roles, including guest, user, and admin.
b. Implement widget sharing and public gallery display capabilities.

Data Storage and Formats:
a. Configure MongoDB for storing application data.
b. Implement local file storage for user-generated content.
c. Support JSON and YAML data formats for input and output.

API Integrations:
a. Integrate OpenAI and Hugging Face API for AI language processing.
b. Configure Axios for handling HTTP requests.

Testing and Deployment:
a. Implement Continuous Integration testing using GitHub Actions.
b. Deploy the application to a hosting provider or platform.

Accessibility:
a. Choose color-blind friendly colors and UI elements.
b. Integrate Google's Web Speech API for improved accessibility.

Localization:
a. Implement American English localization initially.
b. Plan for future localization and internationalization efforts.

Non-Functional Requirements:
a. Ensure maintainability and scalability with Vue 3, Typescript, and Composition API.
b. Optimize performance for user interaction and widget handling.
c. Apply security best practices for data storage and communication.
d. Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
e. Test the application for consistent performance across devices and environments.

Additional Components:
a. Integrate vue-draggable for drag and drop features.
b. Continuously iterate on the design and functionality based on user feedback and analytics.

By following these steps, you can successfully develop and deploy the WonderLab Project according to its Software Requirements Specification (SRS).




Day 1:

Set up project structure with Vue 3 and TypeScript
Install necessary dependencies (Axios, Quasar, Vue-draggable, etc.)
Create basic layout with App.vue, HeaderComponent.vue, and FooterComponent.vue
Day 2:

Implement SidebarComponent.vue for widget assembly parts selection
Develop WonderLab.vue as the main workspace for user interaction
Create WonderWidget.vue with basic input/output properties and connections
Day 3:

Add CustomProperties.vue as a sub-component of WonderWidget for widget customization
Implement basic API integration with OpenAI or Hugging Face API for AI language processing
Ensure responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
Day 4:

Set up a basic guest user role with limited access to features
Add functionality to save/load lab states in HeaderComponent.vue
Implement widget sharing as "shareable" for public gallery display (basic version)
Day 5:

Conduct basic testing and bug fixing
Optimize performance for user interaction and widget handling
Deploy the demo application to a hosting provider (Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel)
This five-day outline focuses on creating a working demo with core features, eliminating tasks related to marketing, extra languages, and other non-essential aspects for a basic demo.
