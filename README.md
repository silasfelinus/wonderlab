WonderWidgets Unleashed ðŸš€

Join our coding adventure to revolutionize AI API interactions by transforming them into customizable, shareable, and fun WonderWidgets!

Core Stack: Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio, running in multiprocess for the ultimate fusion of Gradio's simple API calls and Quart's limitless CSS and JS styling options. (Vue.js upgrade in production)

Value Proposition: "Got a cool idea? Let's team up and bring it to life as a market-ready web app with just a single click. It's coding magic!"

Progress So Far:
Consciously-crafted infrastructure built with modularity, flexibility, and clean coding in mind.
